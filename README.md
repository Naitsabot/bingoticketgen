# bingoticketgen

Generation of bingo tickets that are 3x9 with 15 numbers, min 1 and max 3 numbers per column.

`pdfgen` contains `PDF_ticket_generator()` that can produce `n` number of bingo tickets. There are 4 tickets per page.

`ticketgen` contains `ticket_generator()` which generates a 2-dimentional list representing a bingo ticket.

This was initially written for a bingo-event for bachelor student, so the current version of the tickets have special formatting on the number "69" because, because.
